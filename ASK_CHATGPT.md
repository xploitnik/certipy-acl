# 🧠 How to Use ChatGPT to Analyze Certipy-ACL Output

Sometimes Certipy-ACL successfully retrieves ACEs from LDAP — but due to current terminal display limitations, you won’t see them onscreen. Refert to @KNOWN_ISSUES.md

✅ No problem — you can still extract the full value by feeding the output to ChatGPT.

## ✅ Step-by-Step

1. Save the Certipy-ACL output to a file:
```bash
python3 -m certipy_tool acl \
  -u 'user@domain.local' \
  -p 'Pass123!' \
  -target domain.local \
  -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 \
  --resolve-sids > output.txt
```

2. View and copy the contents:
```bash
cat output.txt
```

3. Paste the full output into ChatGPT and ask **one of the following questions**:

---

## 🔍 Question 1 (Filtered by User SID)

```
Can you analyze this Certipy ACL output and tell me which ACEs belong to my current user with SID S-1-5-21-729746778-2675978091-3820388244-1103? Highlight any objects where this SID appears, what rights are granted (like WriteOwner or GenericAll), and ignore anything outside this domain SID or built-in groups.
```

🟡 **Replace the SID above with your own.**  
To find your user SID, look for the `[INFO] Current user SID:` line in the tool output.

## 🔎 Question 2 (Full Breakdown — No Filtering)

```
Can you analyze this Certipy ACL output and list all ACEs found for every object? I want to see the full breakdown — show me the object, SID, rights (like WriteOwner or GenericAll), and ACE type. Don’t filter anything.
```

## 💡 Tip

Until terminal display is fully implemented, these prompt templates ensure you still get full visibility into what permissions were discovered.

📎 Copy, paste, and adapt — this is the cleanest way to decode ACLs using AI right now.
