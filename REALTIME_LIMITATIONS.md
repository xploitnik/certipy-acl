# ❗ Why You Might See No ACEs — Even If Control Exists

In some environments, when you run this tool, you may see **no Access Control Entries (ACEs)** printed in the terminal — even though you **do** have control rights like `WriteOwner`, `WriteDACL`, or `GenericAll`.

This is **not a bug in the tool** — it's actually **how Active Directory security works by design**.

## 🔐 The Core Problem: LDAP Access Control on DACLs

In Active Directory, **holding powerful rights over an object doesn’t mean you can *see* the permissions** (DACL) of that object.

Unless the querying user has **`ReadControl`** or similar rights like `ListObject`, **the DACL will not be visible** in LDAP queries — even if that user is listed in the ACEs with full control.

So:

- ✅ You *do* have control (e.g., WriteOwner over a user or group)
- ❌ But you can't read the DACL to confirm it
- ⚠️ As a result, **no ACEs are returned**, and nothing is printed in the terminal

This is **exactly what advanced adversaries want** — stealthy access *without visibility*.

## 🤖 Why ChatGPT *Can* See It (But You Can’t)

When we feed the raw binary or hex security descriptor (SD) data into ChatGPT, it acts as a **manual decoder**, processing the data **offline**.

ChatGPT doesn't care about your access rights. It's not querying LDAP live. It’s simply parsing already-dumped security descriptors — like reading a file from disk.

That’s why ChatGPT can tell you:

```
[ACE] Type: ACCESS_ALLOWED
SID: S-1-5-21-...
[+] WriteOwner
[+] GenericAll
```

…even though your live scan showed nothing.

## 🛠️ Planned Fix: Offline ACL Decoding Mode

To overcome this limitation, we are working on an **optional offline parsing module** that will:

1. Dump all security descriptor blobs (raw ACLs) into a file
2. Use a **local ACL parser** or even a **ChatGPT integration** to decode the permissions
3. Resolve SIDs to readable names
4. Print a clean summary of rights like:
   - `WriteOwner`
   - `WriteDACL`
   - `GenericAll`

This will give you full visibility — even when LDAP restricts it live.

## 💡 Real-World Insight

This limitation isn’t a problem — it’s **an opportunity to see how real stealth works** in Active Directory:

> Just because you don’t see control… doesn’t mean you don’t have it.

## 📘 TL;DR

| What You See          | Why                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| ✅ You have control   | ACE exists in DACL            |
| ❌ Nothing prints     | You can’t *read* the DACL     |
| 🤖 ChatGPT sees it    | It decodes offline, no LDAP   |
| 🧠 Solution coming    | Offline parser in development |
